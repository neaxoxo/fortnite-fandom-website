# 🎮 Fortnite Themed Compendium / Fan Website

![Project Banner](screencapture-127-0-0-1-3000-index-html-2025-12-01-15_56_59.jpg)

> **A high-fidelity, fully responsive fan website dedicated to Fortnite, built entirely with core web technologies.**

## 🚀 About The Project

This project is a concept website designed to replicate the immersive experience of a AAA game portal. The primary goal of this repository was to **maximize the potential of Vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** without relying on any external frameworks (like Bootstrap, Tailwind, or React).

By sticking to the fundamentals, I aimed to demonstrate a deep understanding of DOM manipulation, modern CSS layouting (Grid/Flexbox), and semantic HTML structure.

### Key Objectives
* **Pure Native Code:** Proving that complex, modern UI/UX can be achieved with standard web technologies.
* **Pixel-Perfect Design:** Focusing on detailed aesthetics that match the gaming vibe (dark mode, neon accents, immersive imagery).
* **Interactivity:** Implementing dynamic features like search filters and accordions using logic written from scratch.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **HTML5** - Semantic markup for better structure and SEO.
* **CSS3** - Heavy use of Flexbox, CSS Grid, Custom Variables (:root), and Transitions/Animations.
* **JavaScript (ES6+)** - DOM manipulation for interactive elements (News filtering, FAQ toggles).
